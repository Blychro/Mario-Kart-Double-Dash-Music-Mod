# Mario-Kart-Double-Dash-Music-Mod
Replaces all of Mario Kart Double Dash music with Rainbow Road except for Rainbow Road which has a lyrical version found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuX5_OWObA0&amp;t=1s

I do not own the game nor do I own any of the music. All rights go to Nintendo.

Use the arc extractor and arc pack programs to deconstruct and reconstruct the Double Dash .iso respectively.
After deconstructing the .iso, replace the AudioRes file in root folder with the one provided and reconstruct the iso.  From there it should run with the modded music.
